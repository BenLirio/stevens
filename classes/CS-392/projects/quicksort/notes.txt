Objective
Sort:
	Strings
	Ints
	Doubles

lomuto partitioning

pointers, pointer conversion, file reading, type conversion, function pointers, and makefiles

Problem
Submit Zip
sort.c - main
quicksort.h - header library
quicksort.c - implement quicksort.h
makefile - directions for building the project

Do not change headers

Function pointers:

Command Line Arguments:
./sort [-i|-d] filename

-i integers
-d doubles
no flag - strings

Must include <getopt.h> to parse

Error Checking
No input EXIT_FAILURE
Invalid Flag EXIT_FAILURE
Invalid filename EXIT_FAILURE
No filename EXIT_FAILURE
Multiple filenames EXIT_FAILURE
Multiple valid flages EXIT_FAILURE
Multiples flags with invalid flag EXIT_FAILURE

Contents of input file will be correct
Assume each line contains string, int or double
Every line in the file will be the same data type
at most 1024 lines each line will be up to 64
Every Line will end with a new line

You must use getopt to parse command line arguments.
You'll need to become comfortable with void pointers and pointer arithmetic
Use gdb to help find segaults and valgrind to check for memory leaks.
Start this assignment early. The concept is straitforward, but the details might require some time and effort
