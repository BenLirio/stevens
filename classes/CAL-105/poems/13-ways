EXAMPLE: poetryfoundation.org/poems/thirteen-ways-of-looking-at-a-blackbird
I
Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.
# Concrete images

II
I was of three minds,
Like a tree
In which there are three blackbirds.
# Going for something obscure and deep

III
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.
It was a small part of the pantomime.
# Word choice, pantimime, is selected for a certain type of reader

IV
A man and a woman
Are one.
A man and a woman and a blackbird
Are one.
# Could have said 
'A man, woman and blackbird
Are one.'
# But the double and gives it a sense that the black bird is observing
# Or just and addition

V
I do not know which to prefer,
The beauty of inflections
Or the beauty of innuendoes,
The blackbird whistling
Or just after.
# There is both and inflection and innuendoe I am not catching in this part

VI
Icicles filled the long window
With barbaric glass.
The shadow of the blackbird
Crossed it, to and fro.
The mood Traced in the shadow
An indecipherable cause.
# Hmm, not very concrete or coherent.
# But the main purpose is to use the words Icicles, barbaric, shadow, mood, indecipherable

VII
O thin men of Haddam,
Why do you imagine golden birds?
Do you not see how the blackbird
Walks around the feet
Of the women about you?
# Nugget of wisdom

VIII
I know noble accents
And lucid, inescapable rhythms;
But I know, too,
That the blackbird is involved
In what I know
# black bird and nobility are opposites

IX
When the blackbird flew out of sight
It marked the edge
Of one of many circles.

X
At the sight of blackbirds
Flying in a green light,
Even the bawds of euphony
Would cry out sharply.
# wtf

XI
He rode over Connecticut
In a glass coach.
Once, a fear pierced him,
In that he mistook
The shadow of his equipage
For blackbirds.
# There is something that haunts him

XII
The river is moving.
The blackbird must be flying.
# It is part of nature

XIII
It was evening all afternoon.
It was snowing
And it was going to snow.
The blackbird sat
In the cedar-limbs.
# A sense of indefinates with the blackbird
