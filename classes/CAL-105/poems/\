EXAMPLE: poetryfoundation.org/poems/thirteen-ways-of-looking-at-a-blackbird
I
Among twenty snowy mountains,
The only moving thing
Was the eye of the blackbird.
# Concrete images

II
I was of three minds,
Like a tree
In which there are three blackbirds.
# Going for something obscure and deep

III
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.
It was a small part of the pantomime.
# Word choice, pantimime, is selected for a certain type of reader

IV
A man and a woman
Are one.
A man and a woman and a blackbird
Are one.
# Could have said 
'A man, woman and blackbird
Are one.'
# But the double and gives it a sense that the black bird is observing
# Or just and addition

V
I do not know which to prefer,
The beauty of inflections
Or the beauty of innuendoes,
The blackbird whistling
Or just after.
# There is both and inflection and innuendoe I am not catching in this part

VI
Icicles filled the long window
With barbaric glass.
The shadow of the blackbird
Crossed it, to and fro.
The mood Traced in the shadow
An indecipherable cause.
# Hmm, not very concrete or coherent.
# But the main purpose is to use the words Icicles, barbaric, shadow, mood, indecipherable

VII
O thin men of Haddam,
Why do you imagine golden birds?
Do you not see how the blackbird
Walks around the feet
Of the women about you?
# Nugget of wisdom

VIII
I know noble accents
And lucid, inescapable rhythms;
But I know, too,
That the blackbird is involved
In what I know
# black bird and nobility are opposites

IX
When the blackbird flew out of sight
It marked the edge
Of one of many circles.

X
At the sight of blackbirds
Flying in a green light,
Even the bawds of euphony
Would cry out sharply.
# wtf

XI
He rode over Connecticut
In a glass coach.
Once, a fear pierced him,
In that he mistook
The shadow of his equipage
For blackbirds.
# There is something that haunts him

XII
The river is moving.
The blackbird must be flying.
# It is part of nature

XIII
It was evening all afternoon.
It was snowing
And it was going to snow.
The blackbird sat
In the cedar-limbs.
# A sense of indefinates with the blackbird

An unfulfilled dream
Irrational promise of becoming a doctor


kid,
keep your eyes open for the one
mom and I did

A 17 year olds journal with all 
thier options crossed out except for college

Ender,
You recieve the golden ticket,
signed,
the gods in space

They try and get us,
belive the world is round,
this a battle ground
don't let them win

Excuse for irrisponsibility
Postpone responsibility
I mean, there is
free food and I don't have to
work all that hard

Cultural norm
A place your fiend go
Did you hear,

Mind expanding
Intelectual power house

A dating service
Son, Mom and I met in college, maybe you will too
Keep yours eyes open,
You might find the one.

I know its expensive but other options do I have?

Cultivation

Equalizer
Your ancestry is not your choice,
but your mind is

Status currency
Currency of status and responsibility

What is this, and what a funny name, school.
Sounds like pool

Modern Caste system
Misleading equality,

Getting over the S curve

Optional daycare
Free daycare where my kid learns,
how to rhyme

As good as the classmates are
Gastby is an Oxford man, right?

Prison

Freedom

Pay to play
Interuption of the norm
A way to play football without going pro
I like football

Not a place for me
break from home

You know, I didn't really think about it all that much
