Let A1, A2, ..., Ak be a collection of k mutually exclusive and exhaustive events with prior probabilities P(Ai)(i = 1,...k). Then for any other event B for which P(B) > 0, the posterior probability of Aj given that B has occurred is

P(Aj|B) = 
P(Aj n B) / P(B) =
P(B|Aj)*P(Aj) / SUM(P(B|Ai) * P(Ai))
