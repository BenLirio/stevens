\section{Problem}
Let $A$ be that matrix. If $A$ has a null space in $\textrm{R}^4$ that spans two dimensions, I know $A$ must 4 columns, two of which are free. An $m = 2, n = 4$ sized matrix will satisfy these conditions.

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & a_{14} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & a_{24}
\end{bmatrix}
\]
I will first generate my two independent columns in the first two position using a $2x2$ identity matrix. I am allowd to do this becuase I know two columns are independent, and I will be able to generate specific null space vectors if I set my dependent columns to have the correct coeficients.
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & a_{13} & a_{14} \\
0 & 1 & a_{23} & a_{24}
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Let $u$ and $v$ represent each null space vector. After multiplying $Au = 0$ and $Av = 0$, I get the following relations.

$2 + a_{13} = 0$

$2 + a_{23} = 0$

$3 + a_{14} = 0$

$1 + a_{24} = 0$

I notice that all the variables are independent in the equations above, this means I will not have to do any substitution and can just skip to filling in the correct values for each $a_{ij}$

$a_{13} = -2$

$a_{23} = -2$

$a_{14} = -4$

$a_{24} = -1$

\[
A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & -2 & -4 \\
0 & 1 & -2 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\section{Problem}
Let matrix $A$ be the one I am constructing. For the first two vectors I can just add them as columns in my matrix.
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
1 & 3 \\
5 & 1  
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Next, becuase the null space is in $\textrm{R}^{3}$ I will add an additional column.
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & a_{13} \\
1 & 3 & a_{23} \\
5 & 1 & a_{33} 
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Now I will multiply $A$ by the null space.

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & a_{13} \\
1 & 3 & a_{23} \\
5 & 1 & a_{33} 
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
1 \\
2 
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
0 
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Which gives me the following equations.

$1 + 2a_{13} = 0$

$1 + 3 + 2a_{23} = 0$

$5 + 1 + 2a_{33} = 0$

Simplifying I get

$a_{13} = -\frac{1}{2}$

$a_{23} = -2$

$a_{33} = -3$

Now I can substitute these values back into my matrix
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & -\frac{1}{2} \\
1 & 3 & -2 \\
5 & 1 & -3 
\end{bmatrix}
\]
\section{Problem}
I will be using the fact that a matrix which is invertable is indepent columns. By creating matrix $A$ such that the columns of $A$ are $u_{1}$ throuch $u_{3}$ I get.
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
I notice that simply subtracting $R2$ from $R1$ and subtracting $R3$ from $R2$, I get the identity matrix. And since row subtraction can be represented with a matrix $E$ I know that this matrix is invertable and therefore has independent columns.
Now to determine if $u_{1}$, $u_{2}$, $u_{3}$, $u_{4}$ is invertable, I will construct another matrix.
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 3 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 4 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Using the fundamental theorem of linear algebra, I know $C(A) + N(A) = n$ where $n$ is the number of columns of this matrix. I also know that $C(A) = C(A^{T})$ and becuase $C(A^{T}) \le n$, where $n$ is the number of rows, I can assume $C(A) \le 3$, when $n = 3$. Furthermore, I can show $N(A)$ must be at least $1$ in order for $C(A) + N(A) = 4$. Therefore there is at least one vector in the null space of this matrix. Which leads me to the conclusion that while the previous matrix was independent, adding $u_{4}$ made them dependent. Also $u_{4} = 4u_{3} - u_{2} - u_{1}$.
